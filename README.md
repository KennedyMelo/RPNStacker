# RPNStacker
This a question from Compiler discipline, that it is necessary to implement a RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) stacker. </br>
The question was did in C++, tou need the g++ compiler to run this script. For change the input, change the input.txt file. </br>
To compile: g++ main.cpp -o p </br>
To run: ./p < input.txt > output.txt </br>
you can change the "p". </br>
